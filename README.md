## Setup

Before getting started, make sure you have a development workspace where you
have permissions to install apps. If you donâ€™t have one set up, go ahead and
[create one](https://slack.com/create). Also, please note that the workspace
requires any of [the Slack paid plans](https://slack.com/pricing).

### Install the Slack CLI

To use this template, you first need to install and configure the Slack CLI.
Step-by-step instructions can be found in our
[Quickstart Guide](https://api.slack.com/future/quickstart).

### Clone the Template

Start by cloning this repository:

```zsh
# Clone this project onto your machine
$ slack create my-kitchen-sink-app -t slack-samples/deno-kitchen-sink-app

# Change into this project directory
$ cd my-kitchen-sink-app
```

### Sample Apps

This app consists of a number of sample apps. Go over the list of sub-apps below
